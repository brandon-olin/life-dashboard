# The Dichotomy of Control

Epictetus opens the *Enchiridion* with a clean distinction:

> "Some things are in our control and others not."

What is **in our control**: judgment, desire, motivation, opinion.
What is **not in our control**: body, reputation, property, external events.

This is the load-bearing beam of Stoic practice. Nearly every other technique \
rests on it. Anxiety, grief, and anger almost always trace back to placing \
value on things outside your control.

**Practical implication**: Before reacting to any difficulty, pause and ask: \
*Is this in my control?* If not, your only task is to choose your response.

# The Four Noble Truths

The Buddha's first teaching after enlightenment. A diagnostic framework \
more than a creed:

1. **Dukkha** — suffering, unsatisfactoriness, pervades ordinary experience
2. **Samudaya** — suffering arises from craving (*tanha*) and clinging
3. **Nirodha** — cessation of craving ends suffering
4. **Magga** — the [[The Eightfold Path]] is the route to cessation

The medical analogy is useful: identify the illness, identify the cause, \
confirm the cure exists, follow the treatment.

Importantly, the Buddha didn't say life is *only* suffering — he said \
suffering is *embedded in* ordinary experience, particularly wherever we \
cling to things that change.

# The Eightfold Path

The fourth Noble Truth made concrete. Eight interrelated practices, not \
sequential steps:

- **Wisdom**: Right View, Right Intention
- **Ethics**: Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood
- **Meditation**: Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration

The path is described as a wheel — all eight support each other. You \
don't finish one and move to the next; you deepen all of them simultaneously.

**Contrast with Stoic practice**: The Stoics also divide their discipline \
(logic, physics, ethics) but the eight fold path has a stronger emphasis on \
formal meditation as part of the practice.

# Memento Mori

Latin: *"Remember that you will die."*

A core Stoic contemplative practice. Marcus Aurelius returned to it \
constantly in the *Meditations*. The point is not morbid — it is clarifying.

When you hold your mortality in mind:
- Trivial annoyances lose their grip
- Time with people you love becomes charged with meaning
- The compulsion to impress others fades

**The temporal version**: Treat each morning as if you might not see the \
evening. Not as anxiety, but as an invitation to act rightly *now*.

Buddhism addresses the same territory via [[Impermanence]] (anicca). \
The phenomenology is similar; the metaphysical framing differs.

# Impermanence

**Anicca** in Pali — one of Buddhism's three marks of existence alongside \
*dukkha* (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self).

Everything that arises passes away. This applies to:
- Pleasant experiences (so enjoy them without clinging)
- Unpleasant experiences (so endure them without despair)
- The self itself (which Buddhist metaphysics treats as a process, not a thing)

**Cross-tradition resonances**:
- Heraclitus: *"You cannot step in the same river twice"*
- Stoics: the *logos* moves through constant change — [[Memento Mori]] is the practice of holding this
- Taoism: [[The Flow of the Tao]] is precisely the flow of continuous change

The difference: Buddhism uses impermanence as a direct antidote to clinging. \
Taoism uses it as an invitation to move *with* change rather than against it.

# The Middle Way

Before the Buddha's enlightenment, he had tried both extremes: the indulgence \
of a royal life and the severe asceticism of the forest renunciants. Neither worked.

The Middle Way (*majjhima patipada*) avoids:
- **Sensual indulgence**: chasing pleasure as the point of life
- **Self-mortification**: punishing the body as the path to liberation

This isn't just a lifestyle prescription — it's an epistemological stance. \
Right View means neither nihilism nor eternalism. Right Practice means neither \
forced effort nor passivity.

**Compare with Epicurus**: [[Ataraxia]] also rejects extreme asceticism, \
but Epicurus grounds this in the pursuit of a specific kind of pleasure \
(katastematic pleasure, absence of pain). The Buddha's framing is different — \
the goal is liberation from the pleasure/pain cycle altogether.

# Equanimity

A word that appears across traditions but means something slightly different in each:

**Stoic apatheia**: freedom from *pathē* (passions that distort judgment). \
Not the absence of feeling, but the absence of *irrational* passion. \
The sage still experiences *eupatheiai* — good emotions like joy, caution, \
and wish.

**Buddhist upekkha**: the fourth *brahmaviharā* (divine abiding). Balanced \
mind that neither clings to pleasant experience nor pushes away unpleasant. \
Often misread as detachment or indifference — it's closer to *stable warmth*.

**Taoist balance**: [[Wu Wei]] produces a kind of equanimity by not \
struggling against the grain of things. The Tao Te Ching describes the sage \
as unmoved by praise or blame — not because they don't care, but because they \
are aligned with [[The Flow of the Tao]].

The practical question: Can equanimity be cultivated directly, or is it a \
*byproduct* of other practices (right action, meditation, alignment with nature)?

# Wu Wei

Chinese: 無為 — often translated "non-action" or "effortless action."

A central concept in Taoism, especially the *Tao Te Ching* and the *Zhuangzi*. \
The key: wu wei is *not* passivity or laziness. It means acting in harmony \
with the natural flow of things rather than forcing, striving, or contriving.

**Lao Tzu's examples**:
- Water doesn't try to wear down rock — it simply follows its nature
- The best ruler governs so quietly the people barely know he exists
- The skilled craftsman moves without deliberate effort

**Psychological parallel**: Csikszentmihalyi's *flow state* — complete \
absorption in an activity where action feels effortless. Wu wei is something \
like a permanent orientation toward that state.

**Contrast with Stoic discipline**: Stoicism involves active rational effort \
to identify and correct false judgments. Wu wei suggests the effort itself may \
be the problem. Both arrive at [[Equanimity]] but via different routes.

# The Flow of the Tao

The Tao (道) is the first principle of Taoist philosophy. Lao Tzu opens \
the *Tao Te Ching* with a warning: *"The Tao that can be named is not the \
eternal Tao."*

This is not evasion — it's a claim about the limits of conceptual thought. \
The Tao is the pattern underlying all change, the way things move and transform. \
It cannot be captured in a definition precisely because it *is* the process \
of definition occurring.

**Three characteristics**:
1. **Undifferentiated**: before all distinctions (being/non-being, yin/yang)
2. **Spontaneous**: it does not strive or intend
3. **All-pervading**: nothing is outside it

**Parallel with Stoic Logos**: [[Logos]] in Stoicism is also a rational \
principle pervading nature. Both traditions see the cosmos as ordered, not \
chaotic. The difference: Logos is *rational* (accessible to reason); \
the Tao explicitly exceeds rational grasp.

# Amor Fati

Latin: *"Love of fate."* The phrase is Nietzsche's, but the concept is \
Stoic in origin.

Marcus Aurelius: *"Accept the things to which fate binds you."*
Epictetus: *"Seek not that the things which happen should happen as you wish; \
but wish the things which happen to be as they are."*
Nietzsche took this further: not merely *accept* what happens, but \
*love* it — not as resignation but as affirmation.

**The practical difference between acceptance and amor fati**:
- Acceptance: "This is happening and I won't resist it."
- Amor fati: "This is happening and it is exactly what I would choose."

The second is harder and stranger. It requires finding something meaningful \
or fitting in every outcome — including failure, loss, and death.

**Buddhist resonance**: [[Impermanence]] points in the same direction. \
When you fully accept that everything changes, resistance to change \
becomes obviously futile. But Buddhism tends to dissolve the *self* that \
would love or not love fate, whereas amor fati strengthens individual will.

# Ataraxia

Greek: ἀταραξία — *tranquility*, literally "not disturbed."

The Epicurean summum bonum. Often paired with *aponia* (freedom from \
bodily pain). Together they constitute *eudaimonia* for Epicurus — not \
the excitement of pleasure but the stable condition of having no outstanding \
pain or anxiety.

**What disturbs ataraxia?**
- Fear of death (Epicurus: *"Death is nothing to us"* — when death is, \
you are not; when you are, death is not)
- Fear of divine punishment
- Unsatisfied desires for things beyond one's natural needs
- The opinions of others

**Epicurean therapy**: Philosophy is a *medicine for the soul*. The \
*tetrapharmakos* (four-fold remedy): don't fear god, don't fear death, \
what is good is easy to get, what is terrible is easy to endure.

**Compare with [[Equanimity]]**: Stoic apatheia and Epicurean ataraxia \
point at similar psychological states but differ in method. Stoics ground \
tranquility in virtue and reason; Epicurus grounds it in managing desires \
and cultivating friendship.

# The Pleasure Principle

Epicurus is often misread as a hedonist who taught us to seek pleasure. \
The reality is more subtle.

He distinguished two kinds of pleasure:
- **Kinetic pleasure**: active, moving pleasures (eating, sex, entertainment) — \
these are fine but unstable and often followed by pain
- **Katastematic pleasure**: the stable pleasure of *being in a good state* \
— satisfied, healthy, free from anxiety

Epicurus recommended the second and was famously abstemious in practice \
(bread, water, cheese; a small garden; good friends).

**The mathematics of desire**: Natural and necessary desires (food, shelter, \
friendship) are easy to satisfy. Vain desires (fame, luxury, power) are \
insatiable by nature — pursuing them generates more craving, not satisfaction.

**Comparison across traditions**:
- The Buddhist critique of craving in [[The Four Noble Truths]] covers \
similar territory
- [[The Middle Way]] also rejects indulgence without endorsing asceticism
- The Stoics focus less on pleasure and more on virtue, but Marcus Aurelius \
notes that simple pleasures suffice for a good life

# Logos

Greek: λόγος — reason, word, rational principle.

For the Stoics, the Logos is the *active, rational principle* that structures \
and pervades the universe. It is not personal (not a god who intervenes) but \
it is intelligent — the universe is a living rational organism and Logos is \
its intelligence.

**Implications for ethics**:
- Living according to nature means living according to *Logos*
- Human reason is a fragment of the universal Logos — this is why reason \
is the highest human faculty
- [[The Dichotomy of Control]]: what is "up to us" is precisely our rational \
faculty, our share of Logos

**Compare with [[The Flow of the Tao]]**: Both Logos and the Tao are \
first principles that order all things. Key difference: Logos is explicitly \
*rational* and can be grasped (partially) through reason. The Tao exceeds \
rational comprehension by definition. This shapes very different practices: \
Stoics train reason; Taoists try to *quiet* the rational mind.

**Compare with Buddhist dharma**: The *dhamma* (Pali) refers both to the \
Buddha's teaching and to the underlying order of reality. It shares the \
universality of Logos but is framed in terms of causation and impermanence \
rather than rational structure.
